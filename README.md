A react-native, redux, redux-saga and firebase project.

* [Style guide](./STYLE_GUIDE.md)
* [Setup guide](./SETUP_GUIDE.md)
* [VSCode snippets](./snippets.json) for sagas, dumb, functional and container components (makes life _waaay_ easier)

Feel free to [get in touch](mailto:shaun@aux.co.za) if you have questions or suggestions :)

# TODOS

* Refactor wrappers (some of them don't need to be wrappers, they can just be components)
* FileSystem sagas and services based on new RN
* Create ErrorBoundary component and log errors to DB
* System messages management (array of messages displayed sequentially)
* Add a CHANGELOG
* NetworkHandler needs to direct offline operations on db
* LocationHandler permissions handling could be more robust
* Add push notifications setup
* Add storybook setup
* Fastlane integration
* CodePush integration
* Testing integration
* Add phone authentication
* Full in-app password reset methods
* Write script to generate project in one go (saves up to 3 hrs)
