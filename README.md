# React-native boiler-plate

A react-native, redux, redux-saga and firebase project.

* [Style guide](./STYLE_GUIDE.md)
* [Setup guide](./SETUP_GUIDE.md)
* [VSCode snippets](./snippets.json) for sagas, stylesheet, component index, dumb, functional and container components (makes life _waaay_ easier)

# TODOS

* Fastlane integration

## Necessary but new territory (for me at least)

* CodePush integration
* Testing (unit testing, component testing, E2E)
* Continuous integration

## Stuff that should happen in the future, but not now

* Consider react-native-navigation (apparently a performance improvement since it's native).
  -- Not very stable. Waiting for V2.
* Consider reselect selector library.
* Write generator script to generate project in one go (could save up to 3 hrs).

## Enhancements to be developed as needed

* FileSystem sagas and services (moveFile, deleteFile etc)
* Phone authentication
* Password reset in-app (fully fledged)
