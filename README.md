# TODOS

* Get set for transfer to AUX
* Add iPhoneX helper to styleConstants
* Setup project to handle multiple Firebase apps (development and production). Remove config.environment and associated code.
* Consider these tools: https://github.com/bamlab/generator-rn-toolbox. It does everything we need and more.
* Fastlane
  -- Screenshots
* CodePush integration
* Testing (unit testing, component testing, E2E)
* Continuous integration

## FUTURE

* Consider react-native-navigation (apparently a performance improvement since it's native).
  -- Not very stable. Waiting for V2.
* Consider reselect selector library.
* Write generator script to generate project in one go (could save up to 3 hrs).

## ENHANCEMENTS

* FileSystem sagas and services (moveFile, deleteFile etc)
* Phone authentication
* Password reset in-app (fully fledged)
