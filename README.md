# React-native boiler-plate

A react-native, redux, redux-saga and firebase project.

* [Style guide](./STYLE_GUIDE.md)
* [Setup guide](./SETUP_GUIDE.md)
* [VSCode snippets](./snippets.json) for sagas, stylesheet, component index, dumb, functional and container components (makes life _waaay_ easier)
* [Troubleshooting](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

Feel free to [get in touch](mailto:shaun@aux.co.za) if you have questions or suggestions :)

# TODOS

* Add TOC to SETUP_GUIDE and STYLE_GUIDE
* Add version control (react-native-version)
* Add a CHANGELOG that ships with project
* Add terminolgy notes to style guide eg. ref (!node)
* Add push notifications setup
* Fastlane integration
* CodePush integration
* Testing
* Continuous integration

# TBA

* Consider react-native-navigation (apparently a performance improvement since it's native). Not very stable. Waiting for V2.

# ENHANCEMENTS

* FileSystem sagas and services (moveFile, deleteFile etc)
* Phone authentication
* Password reset in-app (fully fledged)
* Write script to generate project in one go (saves up to 3 hrs)
* Consider reselect selector library
