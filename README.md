# React-native boiler-plate

A react-native, redux, redux-saga and firebase project.

* [Style guide](./STYLE_GUIDE.md)
* [Setup guide](./SETUP_GUIDE.md)
* [VSCode snippets](./snippets.json) for sagas, stylesheet, component index, dumb, functional and container components (makes life _waaay_ easier)
* [Troubleshooting](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

Feel free to [get in touch](mailto:shaun@aux.co.za) if you have questions or suggestions :)

# TODOS

* Add notes about spacing and borderRadius from styleConstants and how parents should control a child components layout to STYLE_GUIDE
* Add README template with development, storybook and deployment notes
* Need a docs folder
* Fastlane
  -- Finish iOS setup
* Add notes on tools, ie. react-native-version, fastlane commands etc.
* Fastlane
  -- Screenshots
* CodePush integration
* Testing (unit testing, component testing, E2E)
* Continuous integration

## FUTURE

* Consider react-native-navigation (apparently a performance improvement since it's native).
  -- Not very stable. Waiting for V2.
* Consider reselect selector library.
* Write generator script to generate project in one go (could save up to 3 hrs).

## ENHANCEMENTS

* FileSystem sagas and services (moveFile, deleteFile etc)
* Phone authentication
* Password reset in-app (fully fledged)
