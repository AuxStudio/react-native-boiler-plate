Feel free to [get in touch](mailto:shaun@aux.co.za) if you have questions or suggestions :)

# BUGS

* UploadFile on android is not currently working. Refer to this [link](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase/issues/1057)

# TODOS

* LocationHandler permissions handling could be more robust?
* Incorporate development/production db nodes
* Add troubleshooting doc
* Add terminology doc eg. ref (!node)
* Add a CHANGELOG
* Git versioning
* Add push notifications setup
* Add storybook setup
* Fastlane integration
* CodePush integration
* Testing

# NICE TO HAVES

* System messages management (array of messages displayed sequentially)
* FileSystem sagas and services (moveFile, deleteFile etc)
* Phone authentication
* Password reset in-app (fully fledged)
* Write script to generate project in one go (saves up to 3 hrs)
