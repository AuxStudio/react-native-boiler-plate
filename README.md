# React-native boiler-plate

A react-native, redux, redux-saga and firebase project.

* [Style guide](./STYLE_GUIDE.md)
* [Setup guide](./SETUP_GUIDE.md)
* [VSCode snippets](./snippets.json) for sagas, dumb, functional and container components (makes life _waaay_ easier)

Feel free to [get in touch](mailto:shaun@aux.co.za) if you have questions or suggestions :)

# TODOS

* Add a CHANGELOG
* NetworkHandler needs to direct offline operations on db
* LocationHandler permissions handling could be more robust
* Add push notifications setup
* Add storybook setup
* Fastlane integration
* CodePush integration
* Testing integration

# NICE TO HAVES

* System messages management (array of messages displayed sequentially)
* FileSystem sagas and services (moveFile, deleteFile etc)
* Phone authentication
* Password reset in-app (fully fledged)
* Write script to generate project in one go (saves up to 3 hrs)
